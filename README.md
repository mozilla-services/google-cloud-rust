# Google Cloud Rust Client

This repository contains [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) client libraries to interact with various [`Google Cloud Platform`](https://cloud.google.com/) services.

### Currently in production:

[`Cloud Spanner`](https://cloud.google.com/spanner) (Horizontally scalable relational database)


### Auto-generated:

[`Cloud BigTable`](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable) (Petabyte-scale, low-latency, NoSQL non-relational database)

[`Cloud Pub/Sub`](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) (Messaging and ingestion for event-driven systems and streaming analytics)

[`Cloud Storage`](https://cloud.google.com/storage) (Multi-class, multi-region, RESTful object storeage)


**NOTE: These generated clients are under development and should be considered
experimental!**


## Usage
